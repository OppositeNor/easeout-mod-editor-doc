# Easeout Mod Editor Documentation

* [简体中文](README.zh_cn.md)

One of the fetures of the game is that it provides a high degree of freedom for level editors to create levels for the game.

Although the game is not yet published, our SDK will finish shortly. If you're interested in level making you can check this documentation and prepare for it. However, this documentation might update somehow in the future.

The wiki is not finished yet. It will be available before the game release(hopefully).

If you have any questions please contact me at e-mail: oppositenormal@163.com.
